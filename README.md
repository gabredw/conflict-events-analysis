### Introduction
My data comes from the [ACLED Data Export tool](https://acleddata.com/conflict-data/data-export-tool?event_date_from=2016-01-01&event_date_to=2025-09-18&fields_on%5Bevent_id_cnty%5D=event_id_cnty&%2Fviews%2Fajax%3F%2Fviews%2Fajax%3Fevent_date_from=2016-01-01&viewsreference%5Breload%5D=eJxdi8EKwjAQRP9lzx5stVDzKyLLSsa6kMaQLJUi_rspORQ8zGHmvfkQotwDPBeYaZwKuevtQEkyonGN2sq2JpDbRpmypCf9C-or7k_jOOzooQieo8zbtZVF8d6FjEWLvmJ7d_25Gy6VNlUNM3sEE3LH7w-71Dq1&order=event_date&sort=desc), which includes “type, agents, location, date, and other characteristics of political violence events, demonstration events, and other select non-violent, politically-relevant developments in every country and territory in the world,” according to the [ACLED Codebook](https://acleddata.com/methodology/acled-codebook#civilian-targeting-4). Before downloading the data, I filtered it to focus on events taking place in the countries of Palestine and Israel. The event data I work with in this project takes place between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2024. <p>
My partner used the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zazaucd/conflict-data) from Kaggle, which contains event-level records of organized violence, including the actors involved, conflict type, location, and date. He planned to look at the subset of the data focused specifically on Israel and Palestine. <p>
Through this project, my partner and I posed several guiding questions which we attempted to answer through data analysis and visualization: <br>
* Which group has perpetrated the most violence over time?
* How does the distribution of conflict types involving Israel and Palestine change over time?
* What kinds of conflict has each group perpetrated, experienced, or otherwise taken part in and how has this changed over time?
* How does the distribution of conflict events differ between Gaza, the West Bank, and Israel?
